This open source code is a handy AutoHotkey script designed for presenters and teachers who need to highlight their mouse pointer. The script has these features: ***highlighting your mouse cursor***, ***keystroke visualization*** and ***on-screen annotation***:

### Mouse Highlight
Highlight mouse pointer with a circle or spotlight, and when you click the mouse button it will display a ring (ripple) animation, so that your audience can follow your mouse easily.

### Keystroke OSD (Keystroke Visualization)
It has a Keystroke OSD that can display the shortcut keys that you have pressed, which can make your audience easier to understand your presentation. 

### On-Screen Annotation
You can use your mouse pointer to annotate any part of the screen. The color and pen of the annotation is customizable through the settings file.
